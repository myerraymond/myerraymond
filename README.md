Hi, I'm Myer, a student with a passion for AI and Psychology. Currently pursuing a Major in AI and a Minor in Psychology, I'm eager to apply my skills and knowledge to help shape the world of technology for the better.

Throughout my studies, I've been fascinated by the intersection of AI and Psychology, exploring topics such as human-robot interaction, emotion recognition, and ethical AI. I believe that AI has enormous potential to enhance human well-being, and that we need to ensure that it does so in a way that is ethical, transparent, and beneficial for all.

As a student, I'm actively seeking opportunities to learn and grow in the field of AI. I'm excited to connect with professionals in the industry, collaborate on innovative projects, and contribute to the advancement of this exciting field.
